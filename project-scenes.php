Not destroyed, but completely missing - as in nowhere to be found.  She immediately panics and go straight for the Herman Miller chair in which her wedding dress laid. After seeing the total annihilation  of the dress of her dreams she dropped to her knees, only to find the empty box that contained her wedding ring! she had taken it off while at the spa and now it was missing. She looked over to Barkley. Barkley could not even make eye contact. He knew he was a bad boy. Janet burst into tears. She wiped her face and looked down at a box she had never seen before. it was bright pink and wrapped in a erotic lace ribbon. Inside Janet sees countless notes labeled Chris and Chrissy-Poo covered in lipstick stains. The box smelled of cheap cologne and vodka. "Is Chris cheating on me!!!? she exclaimed.."</p>
