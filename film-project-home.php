Not only that but he has ate the wedding ring, and wrecked Janet's apartment. Janet sees all of this, but is in for the biggest surprise of all, a hidden box!</h3>
                <p>When Janet comes home to Barkley and her apartment, she notices something is off. First of all her couch cushions are missing. Not destroyed, but completely missing - as in nowhere to be found.  She immediately panics and go straight for the Herman Miller chair in which her wedding dress laid. After seeing the total annihilation  of the dress of her dreams she dropped to her knees, only to find the empty box that contained her wedding ring! she had taken it off while at the spa and now it was missing. She looked over to Barkley. Barkley could not even make eye contact. He knew he was a bad boy. Janet burst into tears. She wiped her face and looked down at a box she had never seen before. it was bright pink and wrapped in a erotic lace ribbon. Inside Janet sees countless notes labeled Chris and Chrissy-Poo covered in lipstick stains. The box smelled of cheap cologne and vodka. "Is Chris cheating on me!!!? she exclaimed.."</p>

For the last 60 years he had been a gentle man, but today was different, today Willam didn't care. Janet at took his heart and his kindness.</h3>
                <p>The clerk looked away quickly. Willam turned and walked out of the train station like an aging gunsliner. He liked the new him. Who wouldn't, he was a badass. He still remembers the first time he watched the 'Man with No name' Trilogy, he always wanted to be those guys, now he was!

The bellboy would yell at us and we would flip him off. The same thing, every damned morning.</h3>
                <p>After a generous portion of shit was laid on the lawn of "the KUBRICK" an upscale hotel in downtown Chicago,  Janet would walk me up 12 flights of stairs and proceed to ignore me for 2-3 hours while she Facebook chatted with Marcus, her homosexual wedding planner.</p>

                <p>Nancy's eye's said more than her mouth could have, 'who the fuck is this guy' was surely the exact sentence that rolled through her mind as at an overweight, stinky drunk sat 12 inches to close to her. Nancy had never met Willam, but right away she knew his type.</p>

                <p>As Janet walked into the oh so familiar bar of her youth, there was Jack - and wow did he look great. The one thing she really missed about Jack was his hair. His fair flowed like a greek god, (this was the sole purpose of him buying a convertible) and tonight it was really flowing.</p>

            <p>As Willam and Janet meet with the Wedding planner, Janet can't help but notice a tear run down Willam's cheek.
            She thought back to the last time she saw Willam cry and was impressed she remembered the exact day. It was when the Chicago Cubs beat the Yankees at home 3 years ago. The emotional moment soon disappeared however as Willam ripped the most grotesque fart at the exact moment the priest entered to meet with Janet. "EXCUSE YOU FATHER" Willam exclaimed loudly. Willam then began to chuckle creating a vibration in his stomach that let out little shotgun aftershock farts with every laugh. This of course maybe Willam start to laugh even harder and yell out, 'JESUS, Father, I THINK YOU MAY HAVE SHIT YOUR ROBE.' Janet tried to apologize and tell Willam to leave, but by the time she looked back to him there was no longer a need for her to quiet him, for he was fast asleep on the church floor. 'So I was thinking first corinthians as our opening hymn, what do you think father?' Father Loyd just sat there in shock and disbelief that a man like 'Willam' existed.</p>
